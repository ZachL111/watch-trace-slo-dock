# watch-trace-slo-dock

`watch-trace-slo-dock` is a focused Scala codebase around package a Scala local lab for slo analysis with layout fixtures, stable geometry snapshots, and documented operating limits. It is meant to be easy to inspect, run, and extend without a hosted service.

## Watch Trace Slo Dock Walkthrough

I would read the project from the outside in: command, fixture, model, then roadmap. That keeps the observability idea grounded in files that can be checked locally.

## Reason For The Project

The repository exists to keep a technical idea small enough to reason about. The implementation avoids external dependencies where possible, then uses fixtures to make changes easy to review.

## How It Is Put Together

The design is intentionally direct: parse or construct a signal, score it, classify it, and verify the expected branch. This makes the repository useful for studying observability behavior without needing a service or database unless the language project itself is SQL. The Scala code uses case classes and a compact object API to keep the test path direct.

## Data Notes

The examples are meant to be readable before they are exhaustive. They cover enough variation to show how latency and risk can pull a decision below the threshold.

## Capabilities

- Uses fixture data to keep log shape changes visible in code review.
- Includes extended examples for latency summaries, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents incident slices tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.

## Getting It Running

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.

## Check The Work

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Where Things Live

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Tradeoffs

The repository favors determinism over breadth. It does not pull live data, keep secrets, or depend on network access for verification.

## Possible Extensions

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more observability fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Command Examples

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.
